## WireWorld Cellular Automata GPU Implementation

## Project Description:
This project is an implementation of the WireWorld Cellular Automata. For more information on what Cellular Automata is and why it's so cool, feel free to...The project was put together with the use of Unity 3D. 

## Project Motivation:
This exists as an example of how to run a Cellular Automata simulation on a grid, in Unity, using the GPU. The rules can be adjusted to match other types of existing Cellular Automata rules that currently exist.
