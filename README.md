## WireWorld Cellular Automata GPU Implementation

## Project Description:
This project is an implementation of the WireWorld Cellular Automata. For more information on what Cellular Automata is and why it's so cool, feel free to check out the [WireWorld Repository Wiki](https://github.com/GollyGang/ruletablerepository/wiki") written by Tim Hutton. It details various important pieces of information, namely the rules and how to use them. This project was put together with the use of Unity 3D and various existing assets/packages.  

## Project Motivation:
This exists as an example of how to run a Cellular Automata simulation on a grid, in Unity, using the GPU. Specifically, setting up with the use of a fragment shader and compute shader. The rules can be adjusted to match other types of existing Cellular Automata rules that currently exist.
